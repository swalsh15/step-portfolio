          I'm a rising junior at the University of Pennsylvania studying computer science. 
          I'm currently working as a STEP intern for Google. This year the internship 
          consists of technical training projects and a capstone project. Check out my 
          Github to see what I'm currently working on! 
      </p>
      <p class="about-text">
        Outside of work I enjoy hiking, running, and golf. At school I play on the 
        Women's Ultimate Frisbee Team and am a TA for CIS110: Introduction to Programming.

        You'll be sending the code you write to your host for review, so your host needs access to your repo. To give your host access to your repo, add them as a collaborator. Navigate to your repo's page in GitHub. Go to the Settings tab. Select Collaborators. (Note: If you don't see this, look for Manage Access -> Invite a Collaborator instead) Add your host using their GitHub username or email address (you can send them a quick message to confirm their Github username). Your host can now help with code reviews. Require Pull Requests When you write code, you're going to use pull requests to do code reviews. To prevent accidentally modifying the code without going through a code review, set your repo to require pull requests. Go to your GitHub repo page. Click the Settings tab. Select Branches. Click the Add rule button. Type master into the Branch name pattern text box. Select Require pull request reviews before merging and Include administrators. Click Create. Click Save changes. Tell git Who You Are Before you can do anything else with git, you need to tell it who you are, so it knows who to attribute commits to. First set your email (make sure to use the same email as your GitHub account, and not your @google.com one): git config --global user.email "you@example.com" and then your name: git config --global user.name "Your Name" Modify README
